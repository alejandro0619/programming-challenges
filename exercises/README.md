4) Have the function ```FirstFactorial(num)``` take the num parameter being passed and return the factorial of it. For example: ```if num = 4```, then your program should return ```(4 * 3 * 2 * 1) = 24```. For the test cases, the range will be between 1 and 18 and the input will always be an integer. </br>
